ChatGPT was used to fine tune this code. In this Achievement, the final Exercise went over using AI to help troubleshoot
your code. In earlier Exercises, my tutor suggested the use of ChatGPT to help sort out the problems I was having with
building my code. It was not suggested to me to document the use of ChatGPT and logging all the help it did with my code.
In the future I will be mindful of documenting how I used it. My first run at this Achievement, I relied to heavily on
ChatGPT to structure my code, and it resulted in unresponsive code that did not meet parameters for the task prior to submitting
the Achievement. I went back to the beginning and re-built this code from scratch using local files on my desktop. Uploading to 
GitHub right away felt overwhelming since I failed the first time around. I played closer attention to the reading in each
Exercise and worked on my code as I read along in each section. By 1.7, I needed help to understand what I was supposed to
be learning and what was expected of my code. Per my tutor's suggestion, I only offered ChatGPT small snippets, and I was
more careful to pose my questions to be more specific as to why my code wasn't working, or even to explain the new terms
in the Exercises.
